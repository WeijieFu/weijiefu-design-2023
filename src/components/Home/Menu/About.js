        <p className={styles["p"]}>
          I&apos;m an experience designer, professionally trained as an
          architect and tinkering with code on my own.
        </p>
        <p className={styles["p"]}>
          My background as an architect has taught me the importance of empathy
          and sensitivity for the environment in which users are immersed.
          During my work and study, I have gained experience in researching and
          designing on different scales: from an urban study on how to transform
          existing infrastructure to enhance cyclistsâ€™ experience in Shanghai,
          to user research about improving work efficiency by reinventing office
          landscapes.
        </p>
        <p className={styles["p"]}>
          As a product designer and self-taught web developer, I have designed
          and redesigned portals from the ground up. I know how to build with
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a fresh perspective to maximize the
          user-centered experience. I am also enthusiastic about integrating
          VR/AR technology and architectural knowledge to push boundaries in the
          physical world.
